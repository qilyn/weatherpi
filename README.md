Well, isn't this something! A directory, a set up, everything. 

## Setting up the project
I'm working on Windows, so this guide is for that process (or it will be, one day I will write up something in detail.)
- Install Git (I love Windows, but I keep coming back to Linux-like systems for development.)
- Ensure you've set everything up with SSH, your configs are correct, and so-on.
- Install python. Come on.
- Open Git Bash as administrator and:
  - `pip install virtualenv` following [these instructions](http://www.tumblingprogrammer.com/setting-up-windows-for-python-development-python-2-python-3-git-bash-terminal-and-virtual-environments/#installing-virtual-environment-and-virtual-environment-wrapper), which are magical.
